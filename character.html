            A kindhearted boy. He lived a blissful life with his mother and
            siblings, but his family was attacked by a demon while he was away
            from home. He joins the Demon Slayer Corps in order to turn his
            sister Nezuko, who has become a demon, back into a human, as well as
            to avenge the death of his family by hunting down the demon who
            killed them. Under the tutelage of Sakonji Urokodaki, Tanjiro learns
            to wield Water Breathing techniques in his fight against the demon

            Tanjirou for breaking the rules of the Corps by harboring a demon,
            even if its his own sister. But once we get to know him, he’s so
